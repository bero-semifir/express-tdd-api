Cooper, a widowed engineer and former NASA pilot turned farmer, lives with his father-in-law, Donald, teen son, Tom, and 10-year-old daughter, Murph. After a dust storm, patterns inexplicably appear on Murph's dust-covered bedroom floor. Murph believes a ghost created them, but Cooper deduces the patterns were made by gravity variations and represent geographic coordinates in binary code. Cooper follows the coordinates to a secret NASA facility headed by Professor John Brand, whom Cooper knows."
